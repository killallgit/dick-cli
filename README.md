Dick will create environments on cloud infrastructure with a lifespan - a TTL after which your infrastructure will be completely destroyed. No matter what. 


Usage:

Initialize your dick project with the wizard or pass `--defaults`.

```shell
dick init
```
See the help command for the current complete argument list and enriched docs
